# Output combiner

This program is designed to execute a command-line application and combine its stdout and stderr streams into a single output. This combined output is written to a specified file descriptor. 
The program effectively captures and prefixes the outputs, ensuring clarity by indicating whether the message originated from stdout or stderr.
